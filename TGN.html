  <h3>About us</h3>
  <h4>What We Do</h4>
  <p>We connect established distributors in need of resources, such as homeless shelters or certain churches, to individuals, organizations,
  and companies that want to and have the resources to help! Our goals are based on improving accessibility and the allocation of resources.
  New York has people that want to help and people that are in need, we create an effective way to connect them. By registering, you are
  becoming part of a network in which everyone is dedicated to helping the homeless of New York. Donors and resource centers that are
  registered with the site are connected based on location and resources and services that can be provided or are needed. By establishing
  these connections, we hope initiate and foster relationships between resource centers and donors that will ultimately optimize the efficiency
  and power that giving resources can have, affecting the quality of life of people in need across all five boroughs.</p>
  <h4>Who We Are</h4>
  <p>The Giving NYC is the brainchild of the Girls Who Code summer immersion program participants. Using our new knowledge of coding and our desire
  to effect change in our community, we came up with the concept of The Giving NYC. The idea is to create systematic change to the way that people
  serve the homeless; creating a network will improve the efficiency, accessibility, and utility of donated resources.</p>
  <h5>Anabella</h5>
  <p>Anabella is a senior at Hunter College High School in Manhattan and has lived in New York her entire life. She has a passion for technology and
  the life sciences, and is deeply committed to improving the Hunter community as whole.  The Giving NYC allows her to connect and continue her passion
  for giving back to her community through her skills and interests in coding. </p>
  <h5>Ishani</h5>
  <p>Ishani Chakravorty is a junior at the Dwight School. She has had a home in 5 different countries and moved to New York a year ago. She volunteers
  and works for organizations that work to provide homes, education and health for families in need. Through The Giving NYC, she feels that people
  will not only give back to the community but also have a strong and long lasting connection.</p>
  <h5>Sadia</h5>
  <p>Sadia Wahid is a junior at Hillcrest High School who aspires to make the world a better and safer place for people to thrive in. She has
  resided in New York for most her life with intentions to improve the conditions of her community. She is devoted towards computer science,
  sociology, and art, thus enabling her to start and partake in The Giving NYC with her fellow teammates. Her skills in coding and web designing
  enables her to raise awareness against a prominent issue that persists today.</p>
